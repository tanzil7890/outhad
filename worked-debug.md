[2025-01-15 | 15:45] Integrations Hot Reloading Implementation
**Commands Used**: Edit tool on server/config/environments/development.rb, Write tool for server/config/initializers/integrations_hot_reload.rb
**Response**: Successfully implemented comprehensive hot reloading solution for integrations gem
**Files Modified**: server/config/environments/development.rb, server/config/initializers/integrations_hot_reload.rb
**Technical Changes**: 
- Added integrations lib path to autoload_paths for Rails reloading
- Configured EventedFileUpdateChecker for file watching
- Created reloader.to_prepare block that removes and reloads Outhad::Integrations constants
- Added watchable_files for integrations directory
- Created dedicated initializer with Listen gem file watcher
- Added monkey patch for connector_class method with error handling
- Configured automatic restart.txt touching on file changes
**Status**: Working - Integrations gem will now hot reload when files change, need to test with actual changes

[2025-01-15 | 15:56] Integrations Hot Reloading - Final Working Implementation
**Commands Used**: Multiple Edit tools on development.rb and integrations_hot_reload.rb, Bash: docker-compose restart outhad-server
**Response**: Successfully fixed all startup errors and implemented working hot reloading for integrations gem
**Files Modified**: server/config/environments/development.rb, server/config/initializers/integrations_hot_reload.rb
**Technical Changes**: 
- Fixed Rails.logger nil error by moving log statement to after_initialize block
- Added Rails.application.initialized? checks to prevent constant enumeration during startup
- Enhanced error handling with safe navigation operator (&.)
- Implemented safer constant removal that only targets Source, Destination, and Core modules
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks to prevent Rails startup failures
- Configured proper file watching and automatic restart.txt touching
**Status**: Working - Server starts successfully, hot reloading configuration loaded, ready for testing with actual integration file changes

[2025-01-15 | 16:12] Integrations Hot Reloading - SUCCESSFUL TESTING
**Commands Used**: Edit tool on integrations/source/postgresql/client.rb (multiple times), Bash: touch tmp/restart.txt, Bash: rails runner tests, Bash: curl tests
**Response**: Successfully verified integrations hot reloading is working end-to-end
**Files Modified**: integrations/lib/outhad/integrations/source/postgresql/client.rb (test changes then cleaned up)
**Technical Changes**: 
- Added test log messages to PostgreSQL connector check_connection method
- Triggered manual reload via restart.txt - confirmed workers restarted
- Made second file change - confirmed automatic reload triggered new worker restart
- Verified file changes are present in running container
- Confirmed method loads from correct file location
- Tested both UI (port 8000) and API (port 3000) accessibility
- Cleaned up test changes to restore original functionality
**Status**: WORKING - Hot reloading for integrations gem is fully functional. Changes to integration files now reflect immediately without container restart.

[2025-01-15 | 16:22] End-to-End Integrations Hot Reloading API Verification
**Commands Used**: Edit tool on rollout.rb (remove sources), Bash: curl connector definitions API, Edit tool on rollout.rb (restore sources), Bash: curl connector definitions API  
**Response**: Successfully verified integrations hot reloading works end-to-end from file changes to frontend API responses
**Files Modified**: integrations/lib/outhad/integrations/rollout.rb, Logs.md, worked-debug.md
**Technical Changes**: 
- Temporarily removed Firecrawl and Odoo from ENABLED_SOURCES array in rollout.rb
- Authenticated with API using correct credentials (ryan@outhad.com)
- Used proper workspace header (Workspace-Id: 3) instead of incorrect X-Workspace-Id
- Verified API returned 25 sources when 2 were removed (down from original 27)
- Confirmed removed sources (Firecrawl, Odoo) were not present in API response
- Restored sources and verified API returned 27 sources again
- Demonstrated that integration configuration changes reflect immediately in running API without container restart
**Status**: WORKING - Complete end-to-end verification that integrations hot reloading works from file system changes to frontend API responses. The Rails server automatically reloads integration constants when files change, and API responses reflect these changes immediately.
